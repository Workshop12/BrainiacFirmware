Relay Protocol
==============

> enum - Enumerate the services offered by this devices.
    <service:count>[ <service:count> ...]

    Services:
        Switch - a relay switch channel.
        s - a relay switch channel.

            Status

                s:n <status> - Turn a realy on or off.
                    status: 0 - off
                    status: 1 - on

            Timeout

                s:n:t [timeout] - Set the maximum time that a relay will be on.
                    timeout - The timeout in milliseconds. 0 (or no param) means no timeout.

        d - a directed (reverse polarity) switch.

            Status
                d:n <status> - Choose the direction.
                    status: 0 - off
                    status: 1 - on - with Forward polarity
                    status: 2 - on - with Reverse polarity. (reverse engages the direction relay)


            Timeout

                d:n:t <forwardTimeout,reverseTimeout> - Set the maximum time that a relay will be on.
                    forwardTimeout - The timeout in milliseconds that forward current is on. 0 means no timeout.
                    reverseTimeout - The timeout in milliseconds that reverse current is on. 0 means no timeout.

        p - pwm output
            Status
                d:n <status> - Set PWM duty cycle
                    status: 0 - 255 

            Timeout

                d:n:t [timeout]
                    timeout - The timeout in milliseconds. 0 (or no param) means no timeout.

> set [<service>[:<instance>[:<which>]]] - show settings for the given (or all) services
    <service>:<instance>:<which> <value>
